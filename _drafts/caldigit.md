One of the dreams of a modern geek is to be able to plug in a laptop computer with one cable and have everything connected on the desktop: monitors, keyboard, mouse, external hard drives, audio interfaces, midi devices, etc... I have had a variety of hubs and docks over the years. The closest have come to realizing this dream is having two cables, with a variety of adapters, until now. The Caldigit Thunderbolt Dock is a work of art. It is compact, rich with I/O ports, powerful, and elegant. <!--more-->
