I don’t know if this a new feature or only new to me, but here is a fast way to switch to “Reader” mode on websites using mobile Safari. <!--more--> 

Simply hold your finger down on the AA button in the toolbar and the interface will toggle between full webpage view and reader mode.[^1]

On iPhone you will get a nice little haptic feedback to indicate the switch. When a new webpage loads, this AA button first appears as the Reader icon, but it only lasts for a second, and I am never fast enough to tap the icon before it changes to the text settings icon. If it stayed just a bit longer, I wouldn’t need this shortcut, but I am glad it exists.

[^1]: Also known as a long press gesture. It use to be called “Force Touch” but Apple no longer uses Force Touch on iOS devices.
