I stumbled upon an interesting dialog box while working in Xcode and the Simulator this week. I was logging into one of my developer iCloud accounts to do some testing, and during the login process the following screen briefly appeared. <!--more-->

Not only does this potentially reveal next year's macOS name, but it also indicates a new feature coming to the simulator, the use of iCloud Drive. It is not unheard of for future product names to be discovered in code, but it is interesting that this appeared in the front facing user interface. 

Fun stuff.
