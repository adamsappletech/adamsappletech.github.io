I am a [Pro Tools][1] power user. When I am recording or producing a recording session, Pro Tools is my DAW of choice. It is the industry standard and incredibly powerful. However, sometimes I need to trim an audio file or do some light editing, and for those times Pro Tools is overkill. <!--more--> With Pro Tools I need to have my [iLok][2]  plugged in and when Pro Tools opens, a number of plugins also load. It isnâ€™t a quick in-and-out app. For a quick audio file edit, [Fission][3] from [Rogue Amoeba][4] is my go to app.

[Rogue Amoeba][5] makes incredible audio software, including [Audio Hijack][6] and [Loopback][7]. These are powerful apps for routing audio around your Mac. They also make Fission, a fast little audio editor that is perfect for quick edits and conversions. Fission opens fast and provides a clean interface for trimming audio, adding quick fade-in or fade-out edits, and will export to .mp3, .aac, .alac, .flac, .aiff, and .wav.

Fission also includes a batch editor for conversions. You can drag in multiple audio files and start a queue of exports to all of the above file types.

The Mac is a great platform for high-quality, third party apps that do one thing and do it very well. [Fission][8] is one of those apps.
