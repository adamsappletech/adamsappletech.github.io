[The Best Screen Recording Apps for Your Mac](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/round-ups/best-screen-recording-apps-for-mac/?utm_source=macobserver&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_everything)

> In this category, youâ€™ve got several possibilities. Some are free, some are paid apps. Some require you to install software on your Mac while others will just run from a browser.
