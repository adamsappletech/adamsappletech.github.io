[Creating A “Save As PDF” Keyboard Shortcut In MacOS Ventura](https://osxdaily.com/2022/12/06/creating-a-save-as-pdf-keyboard-shortcut-in-macos-ventura/)

> If you have long been using the old trick to create a Save as PDF keyboard shortcut and recently updated to MacOS Ventura, you may have noticed your old keyboard shortcut doesn’t work anymore. <!--more--> This is because Apple has renamed the menu title for the action, so if you’re using the old keyboard shortcut it will not register. But with a little adjustment you’ll be able to use the Command+PP trick again for saving as PDF in no time. -Paul Horowitz, osxdaily.com

I have relied on this keyboard shortcut for years. It is so handy to quickly hit CMD-P for the Print Dialog and then CMD-P again to save the document as a PDF. Now I know why it hasn’t been working since upgrading to Ventura.
