I have relied on small utility apps for many years. One of these, [Renamer](https://renamer.com), was useful for renaming several files on my computer. I would drag several files into Rename and then I could prepend, append, or delete text all in one command. <!--more-->

Recently, in macOS, the ability to rename several files at once and use find and replace was added right into the Finder. With multiple files selected, right-click on the list of files and choose "Rename." A small window appears that allows for search and replace of characters. [Renamer](https://renamer.com) is more powerful, but this is a welcome addition to the Finder.
