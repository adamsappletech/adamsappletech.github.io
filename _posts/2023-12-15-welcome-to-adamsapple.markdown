My first Mac was the 2002 iMac G4, the one that looked like a desk lamp. It was beautiful. I had experimented with Macintosh in the 1990s, OS 7–9 days while in music school. I was learning to use Finale and Performer on the Macintosh. I had PC computers from Windows 3.1 to Windows XP at home. I was always intrigued with the clean look of the Macintosh interface. Once OS X hit and Apple introduced the innovate iMac G4, I was hooked. I haven’t looked back since.

The Steve Jobs era from OS X, the iPod, Powerbooks transitioning to MacBooks, the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, was a great ride. Apple has been a great blessing in my life. The products are a joy to use and they allow me to be creative in ways that I hadn’t imagined.

This site will be an outlet for me to share how I use Apple technology.

My name is Adam.
