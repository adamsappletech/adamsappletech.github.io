<p>If you are an Apple Developer, then you know the pain associated with downloading a 12GB Xcode installer.<!--more--> Apple wants us to use the Mac App Store to install Xcode, which can be flaky at times.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The Mac App Store page indicates if you are downloading a file with a circular progress indicator, however, once the app starts installing, the circular indicator becomes less useful. Xcode takes a long time to install, and I have often thought that it was stalled.</p>

<p>I recently learned that if you hover your mouse over the circular progress indicator, once the app starts installing, it will show more detail about what percentage is complete. This is a welcome new feature that more users should know about. Have faith, that Xcode install will finish if you let it.</p>

      <p>Downloading from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple Developer Website</a> has been more reliable in my experience. However, if I am not downloading an Xcode beta, the current release version of Xcode is not always available on the developer website. I have been forced to install from the Mac App Store in this case.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
