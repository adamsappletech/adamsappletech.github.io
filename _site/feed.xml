Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">\</span><span class="n">_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">\</span><span class="n">_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># =\&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

Xcode takes a long time to install, and I have often thought that it was stalled.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hover-mouse-mac-app-store_edited.png" alt="Screenshot from Mac App Store" /></p>

<p>I recently learned that if you hover your mouse over the circular progress indicator, once the app starts installing, it will show more detail about what percentage is complete. This is a welcome new feature that more users should know about. Have faith, that Xcode install will finish if you let it.</p>

      <p>Downloading from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple Developer Website</a> has been more reliable in my experience.

It was beautiful. I had experimented with Macintosh in the 1990s, OS 7–9 days while in music school. <!--more--> I was learning to use Finale and Performer on the Macintosh. I had PC computers from Windows 3.1 to Windows XP at home. I was always intrigued with the clean look of the Macintosh interface. Once OS X hit and Apple introduced the innovate iMac G4, I was hooked. I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>The Steve Jobs era from OS X, the iPod, Powerbooks transitioning to MacBooks, the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, was a great ride. Apple has been a great blessing in my life. The products are a joy to use and they allow me to be creative in ways that I hadn’t imagined.</p>

<p>This site will be an outlet for me to share how I use Apple technology.</p>
