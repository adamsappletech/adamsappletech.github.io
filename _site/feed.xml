It was revolutionary at the time for quickly and efficiently searching your hard drive for files and apps. The Spotlight magnifying glass continues to live in the Mac menu bar and is accessed via the command-space keyboard shortcut.<!--more--> While Spotlight has improved over the years, the market for third-party app launchers and search apps have flourished. Some of the top contenders include <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a>. These third-party apps excel at speed, giving Apple’s Spotlight a run for its money. They are fast and nicely designed, causing even Apple to copy some of their interface elements for Spotlight.</p>

<p>Each of these app launchers offer file search, app launching, extensions, keyboard shortcut support, and clipboard history. I have tried most of them over the years and was a devoted Alfred user for many years. While one app will suffice for most users, I have settled on a trio of apps for my Mac setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pasteapp.io">Paste</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="launchbar"><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a></h2>

<p>LaunchBar actually predates Spotlight, coming out in 2001 at version 3 for Mac OS X. It has excelled at keeping user’s hands on their keyboards, using keyboard shortcuts to quickly launch apps, find files, and perform web searches.</p>

<p>I find it especially fast at launching applications. Over time it learns the few keystrokes that I use to search for specific apps, resulting in launching an app in under a second. Since Spotlight comes with command-space by default, I have setup option-command-space for my LaunchBar hotkey.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/launchbar-window.png" alt="LaunchBar Window" /></p>

<p>I use LaunchBar primarily to launch applications, but it can do much more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search Google</li>
  <li>Browse File System</li>
  <li>Find Files and Folders</li>
  <li>Browse and Playback Apple Music Songs or Albums</li>
  <li>Run Shortcuts</li>
  <li>Find Address Book Contacts</li>
  <li>Search Clipboard History</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/launchbar-google.png" alt="Google Search" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/launchbar-browse-files.png" alt="Browse Files" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/launchbar-actions.png" alt="LaunchBar Actions" /></p>

<p>Despite all of this, I have been playing with Raycast recently.</p>

<h2 id="raycast"><a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a></h2>

<p>Raycast is a newer addition in this space and it duplicates much of the functionality of LaunchBar.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I haven’t tried all of its features, but one aspect has won me over and that is file search.</p>

<p>Spotlight should be the de-facto way to find files on your Mac, but I find both Spotlight and LaunchBar to be a bit frustrating when I want to find a specific file. I don’t know why, but I don’t always find the file that I know is there and I end up having to fiddle more than I would like.</p>

<p>With Raycast I type what I think the file is named and one of the many actions that you can perform is “File Search”. Raycast takes a moment to search my hard drive, and has been very reliable in filtering my files down to the one that I am looking for.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Raycast-window.png" alt="Raycast Window" /></p>

<h2 id="paste---clipboard-manager"><a href="https://pasteapp.io">Paste</a> - Clipboard Manager</h2>

<p>Both LaunchBar and Raycast have a clipboard manager, so why do I have a third app for this. I used to use LaunchBar, and before that Alfred, for clipboard history but when I learned about Paste it has been a great addition to my productivity. Paste is cool because it is on Mac and iOS and my clipboard history syncs between all of my devices. I know we have Universal Clipboard on the Mac and I do like being able to hit command-C on my Mac and then paste that to my iPhone, but Paste has a beautiful interface for me to see, search, and pin my pasteboard.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/paste-window.png" alt="Paste Window" /></p>

<p>Paste was added to <a href="https://https://setapp.com">Setapp</a> in the past year, and that was another reason for me to continue to use this for my clipboard history.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Keeping track of all of my hotkeys can be a problem, but I like what I have settled on for these three apps, which don’t interfere with Spotlight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>command-space (Spotlight)</li>
  <li>option-command-space (LaunchBar)</li>
  <li>option-space (Raycast)</li>
  <li>option-/ (Paste)</li>
</ul>

It is the best computer I have ever used. It is so fast and a powerhouse in every way. I use it for Xcode, Final Cut Pro, music production, and it always delivers.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>However, computers are not without little hiccups here and there. Lately, I have had some battery issues when it is asleep. I am sure there is some little app that has been preventing my MacBook Pro from sleeping. When I have reached into my bag to get it out, it has been noticeably warm and the battery is depleting when it should be asleep. In all fairness to the computer, I do run a lot of apps and my menu bar is embarrassingly filled with running applications.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I am still not certain which process has been causing the heat and battery issues, but I did recently find an interim solution. With a short shell script and <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>, I can quickly disable WiFi before I close the lid. This has immediately brought back amazing battery life and my computer is super cool when I pull it out of my bag.</p>

<p>The script for toggling WiFi in the Terminal is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>networksetup -getairportpower en0 | grep "On" &amp;&amp; networksetup -setairportpower en0 off || networksetup -setairportpower en0 on

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I setup a <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> hotkey to quickly toggle the WiFi on and off.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/toggle-wifi-keyboard-maestro.png" alt="Keyboard Maestro Screen" /></p>

<p>I love the Mac.</p>

When I have had the same email address for many years, more and more spam seem to clutter my inbox. Using the same address with shopping online or trying new services and apps, brings with it an increase of junk email. <!--more--> Apple’s “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">Hide My Email</a>” service which is available with an iCloud subscription is a great feature for proactively preventing future spam. You can use a unique email address that will forward to your main email address. It is easy to use and if you notice more spam from a specific place, you can go and disable the unique address and those messages sent to that unique address will go away.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/spamsieve-icon@2x.png" alt="Spamsieve icon" /></p>

<p>I have used <a href="https://c-command.com/spamsieve/">SpamSieve</a> by C-Command Software for many years for filtering out the junk email. SpamSieve is an older macOS app, in fact it has been around since the early days of Mac OS X, 20 years or so. In order for SpamSieve to work its best, you need to have an always-on Mac running Mail. In dealing with spam, some services rely on a server running online to filter messages before they reach your Mac, but with SpamSieve the filtering is done locally on your personal computer. This is kind of an “old school” way to do this, but I find that it works great and is more affordable than other online services.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>You need to have a Mac running Mail at all times for the filtering to work without interruption. I keep my office computer running for this purpose, but you could also have a Mac mini tucked away in a closet in your house running Apple Mail and SpamSieve.</p>

<p>As messages come in, SpamSieve evaluates the message and moves it into a specific Mail folder if it thinks it is Spam. The training works great and you can train messages as “Spam” or as “Good”.</p>

<p>It takes a little bit of setup, working with Apple Mail rules and AppleScripts to get the configuration working. I use the rules and AppleScript support so that I can move messages to either a “train good” or “train spam” folder from my iPhone. Those messages will later be processed and trained when they are noticed on the Mac mini.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-word">The Last Word</h2>

<p>If you don’t have a Mac that you can leave running, then you may want to look elsewhere for spam management. A popular online service for this is <a href="https://www.sanebox.com">SaneBox</a>. SaneBox has access to your email accounts online, and processes your spam and other mail rules on the server side, before your Mac downloads any messages. The service has great reviews, but it is significantly more expensive than SpamSieve, with a monthly subscription of at least seven dollars per month.</p>

<p>SpamSieve is older software, but it has been updated for the latest release of macOS Ventura. It is tried and true for me and still the best way to manage spam email locally on my Mac.</p>

However, I find myself wanting more out of these apps and have turned to 3rd parties for each of them. <!--more--> I already wrote about my <a href="https://www.adamsapple.tech/2022/08/18/my-favorite-email-app-spark/">Favorite Email App - Spark</a>, and today I am writing about my favorite calendar app, <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fantastical-icon.png" alt="Fastastical icon" /></p>

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>

<p>A modern calendar app needs to have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Available and synced to all my devices</li>
  <li>Natural language input</li>
  <li>Support all of the most common accounts (Exchange, Gmail, iCloud, etc…)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above characteristics are the minimum requirements. Fantastical was one of the first apps to use natural language input, which is where you can just type a sentence to enter a new event and Fantastical will parse all of the relevant information. Fantastical achieves all of the above features in a beautiful interface and also adds these additional features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calendar sets. The ability to customize groups of calendars and recall them with a keyboard shortcut.</li>
  <li>Weather forecast.</li>
  <li>Integration with Apple Reminders.</li>
  <li>Menu bar item with quick entry.</li>
  <li>Beautiful and useful widgets on iOS and macOS.</li>
  <li>Integration for scheduling meetings and Zoom integration.</li>
  <li>Apple Shortcut support.</li>
  <li>Focus filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use calendar sets all of the time to see my schedule, my wife and kid’s schedules, and other interesting calendars, which are hidden most of the time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fantastical-calendar-sets.png" alt="Calendar Sets" /></p>

<p>The weather forecast is a really nice addition that shows temperature and precipitation for the upcoming few days. The free version shows three days, while the premium version shows a ten-day forecast.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/weather-forecast.png" alt="Weather Forecast" /></p>

<p>My favorite task list manager is <a href="https://www.adamsapple.tech/2022/04/04/my-favorite-to-do-list-app-things/">Things</a>, but I also use Apple Reminders for certain types of tasks. If I want my Apple Watch to remind me to do something in the afternoon, I will use Siri and set a quick reminder. I also use Reminders for some of the mundane, repeating chores in my life. Reminders sits nicely in the list view alongside my other events in Fantastical.</p>

<p>With a quick keyboard command, I can enter a new event into Fantastical’s menu bar item.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fansticial-menuar.png" alt="Menubar Calendar" /></p>

<p>Fantastical provides around 8 useful widgets on iOS and macOS for quickly seeing upcoming events, reminders, or the date. They also support the recent addition of lock-screen widgets on iOS 16.</p>

<p>I haven’t played much with Focus Filters yet, but I am starting to use Focus more on my devices and love how they sync across devices and can change Home Screen layout and set custom do-not-disturb settings. I need to experiment more with this.</p>

<p>I have been an active Fantastical user for many years, and I continue to be impressed with the attention and care that <a href="https://flexibits.com">Flexibits</a> put into their apps. Competition is good, and I hope Apple will continue to improve the built-in Calendars app, but for me I am sticking with <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>.</p>

It has been an incredible device with its beautiful screen, fast processor, and Apple Pencil 2. When Apple enabled touchpad support, new possibilities opened up to turn the iPad into a laptop replacement. There have been many keyboard case options available for the iPad over the years, but few have checked all of my boxes. <!--more--> I want a keyboard case with the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lightweight</li>
  <li>comfortable keyboard with a laptop-like typing experience</li>
  <li>touchpad for mouse gestures</li>
  <li>easily convertible between laptop mode and tablet orientation</li>
  <li>use the Smart Connector, not bluetooth</li>
  <li>backlit keys</li>
  <li>protective case</li>
</ul>

<p>Many keyboard cases come close to this list, but very few achieve all of them. Apple’s own <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJQL3LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-129%E2%80%91inch-5th-generation-us-english-white?fnode=fee37517c75bfe48526aead0c3d82d62fe80c082d52f08e1bc3e943d4df70eb22e2f3480f4e0eef4c13f4ff13d416ae1605822708458141f753cd221b6eac417f0f7e45da3798aa1d930e820a10d3354d5a9004b4ecfbba1512a015a663d7f5e">Magic Keyboard ($299)</a> for the iPad comes very close, but doesn’t hit all of them, and is quite expensive. The one shortcoming with Apple’s Keyboard is that it isn’t convertible between landscape and portrait. You have to remove the iPad from the keyboard and use it case-less. Then you have to put the keyboard somewhere when you aren’t using it. This is really the only downside to Apple’s Magic Keyboard. If you could fold the keyboard behind the device, this would be my keyboard of choice. Unfortunately for me, though, it is a deal breaker. I don’t want to remove the keyboard from the case every time I want to use the iPad in portrait orientation. I use portrait mode often when reading, or when using the iPad as a sheet-music reader. That, along with the excessive cost of the Magic Keyboard has been enough to make me look elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Smart Connector on the iPad Pro is amazing but underutilized. It allows devices to connect without pairing, and keeps your accessories fully charged. When you start to look for keyboard cases that use the Smart Connector you quickly find that your options are limited. For whatever reason, it hasn’t been widely adopted.</p>

<p>I have been using the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/folio-touch.html">Logitech Folio Touch ($159)</a> with my 11” iPad Pro for the past few years and it is fantastic. It ticks all of my boxes and is still like new after years of use.</p>

<h4 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h4>

<p>With backlit keys and a row of media function keys, the keyboard on the Logitech Folio Touch is a joy to use. I even liked typing on it more than my MacBook Pro 13” with its butterfly keyboard.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I very seldom mistype words and the key travel is very comfortable, considering how thin and light the Logitech Folio Touch is. The backlit keys and the keyboard itself turn off automatically when the keyboard is folded behind the iPad. I don’t accidentally type on it when I don’t intend to. The full row of shortcut keys are very handy, and something that Apple doesn’t even offer on its Magic Keyboard. These keys include quick access to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Screen Brightness</li>
  <li>Onscreen Keyboard</li>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>Key Brightness</li>
  <li>Media Controls</li>
  <li>Volume Controls</li>
  <li>Screen Lock</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trackpad">Trackpad</h4>

<p>The trackpad on the Logitech Folio Touch works well. It is responsive and reliable. In addition to touch gestures, it also has a click mechanism. However, it is a bit on the small side. Apple’s Magic Keyboard comes with a larger and excellent trackpad, with a more of a polished feel to it.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="protective-case">Protective Case</h4>

<p>The Logitech Folio Touch completely encases the iPad for terrific protection. The corners of the iPad are covered and not exposed. All of the buttons are also covered with raised indicators to identify the volume and power buttons. The buttons continue to work well and are easy to use despite being covered. The case edges have a rubberized feel, but the larger handling areas are covered with a very nice fabric. This case does not feel cheap in any way. The build quality is excellent and has held up very well for me. The case also nicely accommodates the Apple Pencil. The Pencil can still easily charge magnetically to the case and flap is also included for keeping track and not losing your beloved Apple Pencil 2.</p>

<p>The case folds into four different configurations for changing use cases from typing like an iPad, to movie watching with a kickstand, and then to portrait tablet mode. It is easy to handle and quickly change and adapt to your use case. When in laptop mode the case can be a little cumbersome when typing on your lap, but works flawlessly on a table.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I highly recommend the Logitech Folio Touch for iPad users who are looking for alternatives to Apple’s Magic Keyboard. The convenience of the Smart Connector cannot be overstated. Pairing was instant, and I have never thought about charging or re-connected my keyboard in the years that I have used it. It is always powered and ready to use. With the difference in cost between these products and added versatility with the Logitech, I am very happy with my iPad keyboard case.</p>

<p>Thank you Logitech for such thoughtful design.</p>

Getting Things Done came out in 2001 with David Allen’s popular book. Apps later followed that were based on the GTD system, including my first favorite task-list app, <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>. <!--more-->  OmniFocus was explicitly designed with the GTD framework in mind. In GTD, you try to identify <strong>contexts</strong> to define where you are or what tools you require to perform a certain task. For example, a context could be the office or your home, for tasks that can only be done in those locations. With well-thought-out contexts, OmniFocus allowed you to filter your tasks to only see what you could work on at any given time.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I used and loved OmniFocus for many years, but when <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> got to version 3, the simplified and flexible interface really won me over. I have been a Things user ever since.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Instead of contexts, Things uses Tags. Tags can be organized like contexts and used to filter your tasks, but Tags in Things has a weakness. You cannot filter your tasks with multiple tags, and while you can assign multiple tags to a task, filters will only show lists of tasks that match the tag exactly. This means that the contexts that I had used in OmniFocus didn’t translate well to Things. I have recently re-thought my tags and am really happy with how it is working.</p>

<h2 id="my-old-contexts">My Old Contexts</h2>

<p>My old contexts followed the GTD system closely. They are tools or locations that are required to complete a given task.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computer (Mac, iPhone, iPad)</li>
  <li>Phone</li>
  <li>Office</li>
  <li>House</li>
  <li>Grocery Store (Walgreens, Smiths, Walmart)</li>
  <li>Church</li>
</ul>

<p>The example David Allen likes to use is that if mowing the lawn is a task on your list, the context would be House. If you are on an airplane and filter by context, mowing the lawn should disappear off the list, because you can’t mow the lawn since you aren’t at the House.</p>

<p>I have a lot of projects that require a computer, so I would use the computer context often. With Things, since I can only filter by one tag at a time, my computer context would include work items, home items, and church items. I found that I didn’t use the filters much because I wanted my filters to focus with more clarity on either work or personal.</p>

<h2 id="my-new-tags">My New Tags</h2>

<p>I have simplified my tags and I only tag items with one tag. My new tags are less about where I am and more about what area of my life I want to focus on. This is not how David Allen intended GTD to work, but this modification has given me more clarity on how I want to focus my attention.</p>

<p>My new tags are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Church</li>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Computer</li>
  <li>Practice</li>
  <li>Errand</li>
</ul>

<p>Some are the same as my old contexts, but these are areas of my life, as opposed to specific locations or tools. It is a small mental shift, but with these tags, I only need to assign one to each task.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/things-tags.png" alt="Things Tags" /></p>

<h2 id="shortcuts---fast-filters">Shortcuts - Fast Filters</h2>

<p>Things has Shortcut support for filtering by tag. Shortcuts for iOS and macOS keep getting better and better. I have easily set up eight shortcuts for quick access to my most used tags. Now with my voice, or with a click of a Shortcut icon, I can get straight to the tasks that I want to focus on. My Shortcuts are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work Things</li>
  <li>All Work Things</li>
  <li>Home Things</li>
  <li>All Home Things</li>
  <li>Church Things</li>
  <li>All Church Things</li>
  <li>Computer Things</li>
  <li>All Computer Things</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/things-shortcuts-2.png" alt="Things Shortcuts" /></p>

<p>These only show what is scheduled for Today, unless it has the prefix “All,” then it will show me all future tasks with that tag. Shortcuts are powerful because they sync between all my devices and can be accessed via Siri.</p>

<p>Task management is an ongoing “task” to find the perfect system. For now, I am pretty happy with Things, Tags, and Shortcuts.</p>

Every time I would open Word or Excel I would get this error in a dialog box:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft Visual Basic Run-time error `53’
File not found: /Libary/Application Support/Adobe/MACPDFM/MacPDFM.framework/Versions/A/MacPDFM</p>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->
<p>I would dismiss it, but it would return every time I opened a file or started the app. It got to be very annoying after a while. Fortunately, there is a fix.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Close all Office applications.</li>
  <li>Go to /Users/your-user-name-here/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Startup/Word.</li>
  <li>Remove linkCreation.dotm.</li>
  <li>Restart Word and problem solved.</li>
</ol>

<p>This should fix the problem for Microsoft Word, but a few additional steps are needed for Excel and Powerpoint:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the SaveAsAdobePDF.ppam and SaveAsAdobePDF.xlam from the PowerPoint and Excel folders next to the Word folder.</li>
  <li>Launch Excel and PowerPoint and go to the menu Tools -&gt; Excel Add-ins… and Tools -&gt; PowerPoint Add-ins…, respectively, and remove the Save as Adobe PDF add-in, by unchecking it and removing it with the “-“ button and then click OK.</li>
  <li>Restart Excel and PowerPoint and the problem should go away.</li>
</ol>

<p>This fix has really saved my sanity.</p>

I have been an Apple Watch user since the Apple Watch Series 3. My current watch is a Series 5. I had planned on this Fall being my time to upgrade with whatever was released. Each series has been fairly incremental, which is fine when you wait two to three years to upgrade. Those incremental updates each year equate to a nice upgrade every few years.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The Apple Watch Ultra is very cool, but not for me. I am not an outdoor enthusiast and this watch is tailor made for serious hiking, running, or diving. It has a huge screen, by watch standards, at 49mm. I typically opt for the smaller watch sizes and have been happy with my 40mm Series 5. The Ultra is chunky and overkill for me. The orange programmable button is cool, but with it being double the price of the Series 8 I haven’t been tempted by the Ultra.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/apple-watch-ultra.jpeg" alt="Apple Watch Ultra" /></p>

<p>So, if no Ultra, then am I ordering a Series 8? I thought this would be a no brainer, but found myself a bit underwhelmed by the Series 8. Don’t get me wrong, it is a nice upgrade when coming from the Series 5. It has a larger screen, which is also edge to edge, a faster processor, blood oxygen meter, and fast charging. But wait, this list of features were all available on last year’s Series 7. The Series 8 only has two new features from the Series 7: a temperature sensor for cycle tracking and ovulation prediction, and car crash detection.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/assets/apple-watch-series-8.jpeg" alt="Apple Watch Series 8" /></p>

<p>These limited new features caused me to reconsider my upgrade plans this time. I considered just sticking with my Series 5 for one more year and to upgrade next Fall to the Series 9. However, I have really been looking forward to upgrading this year. My Series 5 is still working great, but the larger edge to edge screen of the Series 7 has been enticing. I am now coding Apple Watch apps, and having just a little more screen real estate would be nice.</p>

<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

<p>After the Apple Watch Series 8 went on sale, my inbox was inundated with advertisements for discounted Series 7 Apple Watches. Many of these came from Amazon and were used watches. This got me to also start looking at Apple’s refurbished models. Only cellular editions were available at first and I tend to stick to the GPS models. Late last week Apple’s refurbished list started to include Nike GPS versions of the Series 7, $100 less expensive than the Series 8. I took the plunge and ordered a Midnight colored, GPS Nike Series 7 with a Nike sports band. I have always ordered the Nike versions because I liked the band options and the additional watch faces. With the Series 8, Apple is no longer selling Nike versions. Everyone now gets the Nike watch faces, and you can order Nike bands separately.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/apple-watch-series-7.jpg" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" /></p>

<p>My Series 7 arrived quickly and its awesome. It feels like new and I love the larger screen. One surprise is that the processor is noticeably faster. The interface is much snappier and more delightful to use than my old Series 5. I am also enjoying the fast charging. You have to use a Apple’s fast-charge cable, which comes with the Series 7, but it’s great getting to 80% in 45 minutes.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I wonder what the Series 9 will have in store…</p>
