You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUPWhere YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:def print\_hi(name)  puts "Hi, #{name}"endprint\_hi('Tom')# =\&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk."

      "content"  : "If you are an Apple Developer, then you know the pain associated with downloading a 12GB Xcode installer. Apple wants us to use the Mac App Store to install Xcode, which can be flaky at times.1 The Mac App Store page indicates if you are downloading a file with a circular progress indicator, however, once the app starts installing, the circular indicator becomes less useful. Xcode takes a long time to install, and I have often thought that it was stalled.I recently learned that if you hover your mouse over the circular progress indicator, once the app starts installing, it will show more detail about what percentage is complete. This is a welcome new feature that more users should know about. Have faith, that Xcode install will finish if you let it.            Downloading from the Apple Developer Website has been more reliable in my experience. However, if I am not downloading an Xcode beta, the current release version of Xcode is not always available on the developer website. I have been forced to install from the Mac App Store in this case. &#8617;      "

I was learning to use Finale and Performer on the Macintosh. I had PC computers from Windows 3.1 to Windows XP at home. I was always intrigued with the clean look of the Macintosh interface. Once OS X hit and Apple introduced the innovate iMac G4, I was hooked. I haven’t looked back since.The Steve Jobs era from OS X, the iPod, Powerbooks transitioning to MacBooks, the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, was a great ride. Apple has been a great blessing in my life. The products are a joy to use and they allow me to be creative in ways that I hadn’t imagined.This site will be an outlet for me to share how I use Apple technology.My name is Adam.Welcome to adamsapple."
