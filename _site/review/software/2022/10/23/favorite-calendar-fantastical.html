    <p>The built-in Apple apps for Mail, Calendars, and Reminders have improved each year and are solid apps. However, I find myself wanting more out of these apps and have turned to 3rd parties for each of them. <!--more--> I already wrote about my <a href="https://www.adamsapple.tech/2022/08/18/my-favorite-email-app-spark/">Favorite Email App - Spark</a>, and today I am writing about my favorite calendar app, <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fantastical-icon.png" alt="Fastastical icon" /></p>

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>

<p>A modern calendar app needs to have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Available and synced to all my devices</li>
  <li>Natural language input</li>
  <li>Support all of the most common accounts (Exchange, Gmail, iCloud, etc…)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above characteristics are the minimum requirements. Fantastical was one of the first apps to use natural language input, which is where you can just type a sentence to enter a new event and Fantastical will parse all of the relevant information. Fantastical achieves all of the above features in a beautiful interface and also adds these additional features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calendar sets. The ability to customize groups of calendars and recall them with a keyboard shortcut.</li>
  <li>Weather forecast.</li>
  <li>Integration with Apple Reminders.</li>
  <li>Menu bar item with quick entry.</li>
  <li>Beautiful and useful widgets on iOS and macOS.</li>
  <li>Integration for scheduling meetings and Zoom integration.</li>
  <li>Apple Shortcut support.</li>
  <li>Focus filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use calendar sets all of the time to see my schedule, my wife and kid’s schedules, and other interesting calendars, which are hidden most of the time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fantastical-calendar-sets.png" alt="Calendar Sets" /></p>

<p>The weather forecast is a really nice addition that shows temperature and precipitation for the upcoming few days. The free version shows three days, while the premium version shows a ten-day forecast.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/weather-forecast.png" alt="Weather Forecast" /></p>

<p>My favorite task list manager is <a href="https://www.adamsapple.tech/2022/04/04/my-favorite-to-do-list-app-things/">Things</a>, but I also use Apple Reminders for certain types of tasks. If I want my Apple Watch to remind me to do something in the afternoon, I will use Siri and set a quick reminder. I also use Reminders for some of the mundane, repeating chores in my life. Reminders sits nicely in the list view alongside my other events in Fantastical.</p>

<p>With a quick keyboard command, I can enter a new event into Fantastical’s menu bar item.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fansticial-menuar.png" alt="Menubar Calendar" /></p>

<p>Fantastical provides around 8 useful widgets on iOS and macOS for quickly seeing upcoming events, reminders, or the date. They also support the recent addition of lock-screen widgets on iOS 16.</p>

<p>I haven’t played much with Focus Filters yet, but I am starting to use Focus more on my devices and love how they sync across devices and can change Home Screen layout and set custom do-not-disturb settings. I need to experiment more with this.</p>

<p>I have been an active Fantastical user for many years, and I continue to be impressed with the attention and care that <a href="https://flexibits.com">Flexibits</a> put into their apps. Competition is good, and I hope Apple will continue to improve the built-in Calendars app, but for me I am sticking with <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>.</p>
